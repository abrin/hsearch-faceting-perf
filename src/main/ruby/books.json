Having gained support from industry leaders such as IBM, Oracle, Novell, Sybase, and others, JMS compliant message queing products are now being offered, which places even more urgency on the enterprise developer to learn about this key product.

Ajax uses familiar web technologies-DHTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript-in radically different ways resulting in a much richer user experience. The key to success lies in knowing how to orchestrate them as a coherent whole, splitting off parts of what is normally done by the server and putting it into the browser for instantaneous response to user input. Ajax allows a new breed of web applications with the rich expressiveness of desktop applications.This book helps developers realize that promise-it explains the big picture and how to unlearn many old coding habits. It explains the design patterns and best practices to create a live interface for the user, not get in his way. It also discusses important Ajax issues: how to make good use of network bandwidth, and how to identify, and avoid, common Ajax pitfalls. The book is aimed at all web developers with prior experience in web technologies, independent of the server technologies used. Examples of server code in the book are in Java and .NET.","publisher_name":"Manning","title":"Ajax in Action","author_data":[{"id":"dave_crane","name":"Dave Crane"},{"id":"eric_pascarello","name":"Eric Pascarello"}]},{"isbn13":"9780133046199","isbn10":"0133046192","language":"eng","dewey_decimal":"","subject_ids":["computer_software_development","software_computadoras_desarrollo"],"publisher_id":"manning","physical_description_text":"xxii, 356 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.","dewey_normal":"0","title_long":"","notes":"Includes bibliographical references (p. 349-350) and index.\n\nIncluye referencias bibliogr�ficas(p.349-350) e �ndice.","publisher_text":"Greenwich : Manning, c1997.","title_latin":"Designing hard software","marc_enc_level":"","edition_info":"(PH : hc : acid-free paper)","awards_text":"","urls_text":"","lcc_number":"QA76.76","book_id":"designing_hard_software","summary":"","publisher_name":"Manning","title":"Designing hard software","author_data":[{"id":"bennett_douglas_h","name":"Bennett, Douglas H."}]},{"title":"Designing hard software","summary":"","publisher_name":"Manning","author_data":[{"name":"Bennett, Douglas H.","id":"bennett_douglas_h"}],"book_id":"designing_hard_software_a01","lcc_number":"QA76.76","urls_text":"","awards_text":"","title_long":"","dewey_normal":"0","edition_info":"(Manning hc : acid-free paper)","marc_enc_level":"","title_latin":"Designing hard software","notes":"Includes bibliographical references (p. 349-350) and index.\n\nIncluye referencias bibliogr�ficas(p.349-350) e �ndice.","publisher_text":"Greenwich : Manning, c1997.","isbn10":"188477721X","isbn13":"9781884777219","physical_description_text":"xxii, 356 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.","publisher_id":"manning","subject_ids":["computer_software_development","software_computadoras_desarrollo"],"language":"eng","dewey_decimal":""},{"awards_text":"","lcc_number":"TK5105.35","book_id":"planning_and_managing_atm_networks","urls_text":"George Mason holdings http://magik.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&FT=%22%28OCoLC%2934192237%22&CNT=25+records+per+page","author_data":[{"name":"Minoli, Daniel","id":"minoli_daniel"},{"id":"thomas_w_golway","name":"Thomas W.

In practice some objects must deal with aspects that are not their main business. A method to modularize aspects-and benefit from a clean maintainable result-is called aspect-oriented programming. AspectJ is an open-source Java extension and compiler designed for AOP development. Now integrated with Eclipse, NetBeans, JBuilder, and other IDEs, AspectJ v1.1 is ready for the real world. It is time to move from AOP theory and toy examples to AOP practice and real applications. With this unique book you can make that move. It teaches you AOP concepts, the AspectJ language, and how to develop industrial-strength systems. It shows you examples which you can reuse. It unleashes the true power of AOP through unique patterns of AOP design. When you are done, you will be eager-and able-to build new systems, and enhance your existing ones, with the help of AOP.

This is the best and most up-to-date book to focus specifically on the Java 2 Platform's networking abilities, in all their various forms. Providing a thorough grounding in, and complete reference to, the Java technologies that are fundamental to network programming, with a specific focus on streams, the book then proceeds to detail how to implement robust, real-world Java-based network applications. The book begins with a complete discussion of Java streams, covering not only the concept behind and API of streams but also, more importantly, how to customize and extend the streams for your own purposes. All the standard Java streams are covered, including byte streams, character streams and the object streams. The importance of streams is stressed throughout the book, with later customized streams for parsing DNS records, HTTP requests, sending HTTP responses, etc. In the subsequent networking chapters, the book proceeds to cover the TCP/IP and UDP/IP networking protocols in depth, with many examples of network clients and servers including a DNS client, finger client, Web server and various chat systems, among others. It then details how to use multicast for efficient multiparty communications, and provides extensive details of the Java URL API including example URL handlers for accessing various Internet protocols. Following this is a thorough description if the RMI, CORBA and Servlet networking APIs, and how these can be used to develop distributed and Web-based network systems. As a yardstick for comparing the different technologies, an example of a distributed list datastructure is implemented thrice, with sockets, RMI and servlets. Finally, the book wraps up by combining custom streams and networking into a complex, comprehensive example: message streams that allow multiple network applications to be seamlessly and transparently multiplexed down a single network connection, while automatically hiding problems such as network delays or even failures. What is perhaps most impressive about this book is the wealth of up-to-date, real-world applications provided, showing how to properly develop extensible network systems using the Java 2 platform. These applications go far beyond the simple examples of other texts available, demonstrating how to effectively harness Java's different APIs into coherent, complex systems. Source for the examples is available online at the author's Website.","publisher_name":"Manning Publications","subject_ids":[],"publisher_id":"manning_publications","physical_description_text":"7.5\"x8.9\"x1.8\"; 807 pages; 3.0 lb","language":"","dewey_decimal":"","isbn10":"188477749X","isbn13":"9781884777493","edition_info":"Paperback; 1999-07-01","notes":"","publisher_text":"Manning Publications","marc_enc_level":"~","title_latin":"Java Network Programming","title_long":"Java Network Programming: A Complete Guide to Networking, Streams, and Distributed Computing","dewey_normal":"0"},{"awards_text":"","book_id":"java_reflection_in_action","urls_text":"","lcc_number":"","author_data":[{"name":"Forman, Ira N.","id":"forman_ira_n"},{"id":"nate_forman","name":"Nate Forman"},{"name":"PhD., Ira R.

Johnson's new Elements of Programming with Perl is titled in such close proximity to two classic texts--Strunk & White's Elements of Style and Kernighan & Plauger's Elements of Programming Style--as to beg comparison. Best not, and more is the pity. Perl strives to be both a natural language like English and a structured language like C, but Johnson evidently does not see the value in writing a prescriptive book as the other \"Elements of\" authors have. Rather, he has written a review of basic Perl for the converted and initiated. But just as an inexperienced carver cannot learn good carving practice with neither a Swiss Army knife nor a chain saw, a neophyte coder cannot learn good programming with a tool that has been called the \"Swiss army chain saw\" of programming languages. Can anyone learn good programming style from Perl at all? Better we should learn style elsewhere and bring what we already know to the notoriously laissez-faire language. Perl was developed by linguistic enthusiasts to model a natural language, viz., an idiom consisting of a redundant vocabulary, syntax, and grammar with flexible rules, learnable by example or trial and error. Awk programmers can convert awk scripts to Perl with a utility, then learn Perl by fathoming the output. But where is the centrality of cold, inflexible logic in the design of supportable code? The essential tension in Perl for programming beginners lies between the natural language aspects of Perl (redundancy and flexibility) and the crucial need for discipline in writing programs. Johnson draws his hoe into this fertile terrain but ends up plowing old ground. He adopts a didactic voice and follows a predictable pedagogical path from programming illiteracy through technical proficiency. He introduces task groups--processing text, lists, input/output, modules, debugging--and stops at introductions to modules and object-oriented code. The book is studded with examples, exercises, tips, and tricks gleaned from years of \"speaking Perl,\" but it avoids being prescriptive, and his casual advice is sometimes disconcerting. He discusses white space in formatting code, but he breezes past error handling. He teaches recursion without warning that it is a support nightmare. Often he hides behind Perl's creed that \"there is more than one way to do it\" to avoid advocating what the newbies need: one better-than-average way to do it. Johnson cannot be both advocate of Perl and teacher of beginning programming, though he has tried: had his experiment been bolder, it would deserve wider attention within the Perl and computer science communities. --Peter Leopold","title":"Elements of Programming with Perl","awards_text":"","book_id":"elements_of_programming_with_perl","lcc_number":"","urls_text":""},{"dewey_decimal":"","language":"","subject_ids":[],"publisher_id":"manpocket","physical_description_text":"","isbn13":"9789176435243","isbn10":"9176435245","notes":"","publisher_text":"ManPocket","title_latin":"Vatten melonen","marc_enc_level":"~","edition_info":"Mass Market Paperback; 2001","dewey_normal":"0","title_long":"","awards_text":"","book_id":"vatten_melonen","lcc_number":"","urls_text":"","author_data":[{"name":"Keyes, Marian","id":"keyes_marian"}],"publisher_name":"ManPocket","summary":"","title":"Vatten melonen"},{"physical_description_text":"400 pages","subject_ids":[],"publisher_id":"manning_publications","language":"","dewey_decimal":"005","isbn10":"1932394826","isbn13":"9781932394825","edition_info":"Paperback; 2007-01-01","title_latin":"Ibatis in Action","marc_enc_level":"~","publisher_text":"Manning Publications","notes":"","title_long":"","dewey_normal":"5","urls_text":"","lcc_number":"","book_id":"ibatis_in_action","awards_text":"","author_data":[{"id":"clinton_begin","name":"Clinton Begin"},{"id":"brandon_goodin","name":"Brandon Goodin"},{"name":"Larry Meadors","id":"larry_meadors"}],"title":"Ibatis in Action","summary":"iBATIS in Action teaches Java developers and architects how to use the iBATIS framework to map relational databases to object-oriented programs.

GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library and Adam Tacy a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library. There is a new emphasis on building rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies. In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed. GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended. GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.

To make Perl more accessible, Dr. Tim Maher has over the years designed and taught an essential subset of the language that is smaller, yet practical and powerful. With this engaging book you can now benefit from Minimal Perl, even if all you know about Unix is grep. You will learn how to write simple Perl commands-many just one-liners-that go far beyond the limitations of Unix utilities, and those of Linux, MacOS/X, etc. And you'll acquire the more advanced Perl skills used in scripts by capitalizing on your knowledge of related Shell resources. Sprinkled throughout are many Unix-specific Perl tips. This book is especially suitable for system administrators, webmasters, and software developers.","publisher_name":"Manning Publications","author_data":[{"id":"tim_maher","name":"Tim Maher"}]},{"dewey_normal":"0","title_long":"IntelliJ IDEA in Action (In Action series)","marc_enc_level":"~","title_latin":"IntelliJ IDEA in Action","notes":"","publisher_text":"Manning Publications","edition_info":"Paperback; 2006-03-01","isbn13":"9781932394443","isbn10":"1932394443","language":"","dewey_decimal":"","physical_description_text":"450 pages","publisher_id":"manning_publications","subject_ids":[],"publisher_name":"Manning Publications","summary":"This book will help developers dig a little deeper into IDEA and embrace its streamlining features which allow for more time to be spent on project design rather than code management. Without some educational investment, however, IDEA can be just another editor. That then, is the purpose of this book. To not only get you up and running quickly, but to teach you how to use IDEA's powerful software development tools to their fullest advantage. Important product features, including the debugger, source code control, and the many code generation tools, are carefully explained and accompanied by tips and tricks that will leave even experienced IDEA users with \"Eureka!\" moments of informed programming. Coders just graduating from NOTEPAD and Java IDE veterans alike will profit from the powerful and timesaving expertise provided in this essential programmer's resource. IDEA is a next-generation IDE for Java, an Integrated Development Environment. As the term IDE implies, IDEA integrates or combines all of the tools needed to develop Java software into a single application and interface. In other words, IDEA is a tool that helps develop Java applications more quickly, easily, and intelligently. IDEA can help with every phase of a project, from design and development to testing and deployment.

Their contents have immediate positive impact on everything they touch, from the popularity of the underlying language to the careers of the developers they reach. Even mediocre GUI books have a beneficial impact. John E. Grayson's deeply thought out, maturely written Python and Tkinter Programming does the double service of being a excellent object-oriented GUI book and communicating the standard for Tk-widget-based GUI development to the Python community. The short-term result will be a rapid expansion in the popularity of Python itself; the long-term result will be a new batch of supportable, reusable code. Grayson begins with a three-line \"hello world\" variant that works out of the box. He moves quickly to a variety of GUI calculators to exhibit buttons and label widgets. Familiarity with Tk from Tcl/Tk or Perl/Tk is helpful but not essential. The convenient bonus of the Python implementation is its inclusion in the standard Python release, of which the current stable version is 1.5. Nearly half of the book is dedicated to Tk widget implementations and constitutes a translation of Tk into Python. By itself, it is a good teaching tool for students of Python who already know Tk in one of its other manifestations. Appendices covering build/install issues Python megawidgets and a Tkinter reference manual comprise nearly 40 percent of the book, leaving a brief 15 percent for the introductory tutorial, application building, and performance tuning. A late chapter on threads suggests a broad range of client/server applications, but is too brief to be more than a tease. Throughout the text, code snippets are presented in coherent blocks with annotations sensibly appearing as clearly numbered end notes to those blocks. Grayson presents cross-platform issues with maturity and candor. While Python for Windows and Macintosh environments is stable, he asserts, the Tkinter module does not have the same global look-and-feel control. Fonts and colors are dictated partially by the platform OS. The subtle challenge for developers is to develop supportable code in the breakneck boss-pleasing, GUI-driven environment. Grayson's elegant introduction to Tkinter advances the subtext of supportability noticeably farther along. By documenting Tkinter, he will push a group of laggard hackers to learn object-oriented principles. And that may be his lasting contribution. --Peter Leopold","publisher_name":"Manning Publications","title":"Python and Tkinter Programming","author_data":[{"id":"grayson_john","name":"Grayson, John"}],"isbn13":"9781884777813","isbn10":"1884777813","language":"","dewey_decimal":"005.133","physical_description_text":"688 pages","publisher_id":"manning_publications","subject_ids":[],"dewey_normal":"5.133","title_long":"","title_latin":"Python and Tkinter Programming","marc_enc_level":"~","notes":"","publisher_text":"Manning Publications","edition_info":"Paperback; 2000-01"},{"publisher_name":"Manning Publications","summary":"For programmers who are already familiar with Java, this book offers new techniques on how to develop distributed applications.","title":"Distributed Programming with Java","author_data":[{"id":"mahmoud_qusay_h","name":"Mahmoud, Qusay H."}],"awards_text":"","book_id":"distributed_programming_with_java","urls_text":"","lcc_number":"","dewey_normal":"5.2762","title_long":"","title_latin":"Distributed Programming with Java","marc_enc_level":"~","publisher_text":"Manning Publications","notes":"","edition_info":"Paperback; 1999-09-01","isbn13":"9781884777653","isbn10":"1884777651","dewey_decimal":"005.2762","language":"","physical_description_text":"320 pages","publisher_id":"manning_publications","subject_ids":[]},{"title_long":"","dewey_normal":"5","edition_info":"Paperback; 2007-04-15","marc_enc_level":"~","title_latin":"EJB 3 in Action","notes":"","publisher_text":"Manning Publications","isbn10":"1933988347","isbn13":"9781933988344","physical_description_text":"712 pages","publisher_id":"manning_publications","subject_ids":[],"dewey_decimal":"005","language":"","title":"EJB 3 in Action","publisher_name":"Manning Publications","summary":"EJB 3 in Action tackles EJB 3 and the Java Persistence API head-on, providing practical code samples, real-life scenarios, best practices, design patterns, and performance tuning tips.

They reduce the pain of handling cross-browser inconsistencies, they add useful language features, and provide sophisticated functionality. Of these, Prototype is the most popular JavaScript and Ajax framework for low-level user interface features such as animation, drag and drop, and pre-built widgets. Together, they free the developer up to concentrate on building the application. They make a rich user experience easy to achieve. This book guides the reader through the Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries feature-by-feature.

With C++/CLI, developers can integrate existing C++ code into the .NET platform without rewriting their applications. This book explores the C++/CLI syntax, teaches how to mix native C++ and managed .NET code, and shows how to integrate C++ with Windows Forms, WPF (Avalon), and WCF (Indigo). Imagine taking a C++-based program you've been using for a decade and giving it a snazzy new interface using Windows Presentation Foundation. How about making your old business applications talk to your new ones using Windows Communication Foundation. C++/CLI makes this--and more--possible. C++/CLI in Action shows you how to bridge the gap between your existing C++ code and the .NET platform. C++/CLI in Action will help you if: You're hesitant to migrate to .NET because it means rewriting code in C# or VB. You have significant C++ expertise that you want to leverage in the .NET. You only need to use pieces of the .NET framework, such as Windows Forms or web services. There's no fluff here. Designed for readers who already know C++, this book starts by teaching the unique aspects of the C++/CLI language.

The intended readers are programmers, architects, and project managers who have to process large amounts of data offline. Hadoop in Action will lead the reader from obtaining a copy of Hadoop to setting it up in a cluster and writing data analytic programs. The book begins by making the basic idea of Hadoop and MapReduce easier to grasp by applying the default Hadoop installation to a few easy-to-follow tasks, such as analyzing changes in word frequency across a body of documents. The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action. Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework. This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java.

The book offers detailed strategies for using Ruby in a large-scale environment. You'll see concrete examples of integration, messaging, web development, and databases, all presented in a clear Problem/Solution format. This book won't help you push your deadline back, but it will help you get the job done in less time. Above all, Ruby in Practice is a practical book for developers who want an in depth understanding of the Ruby language and its toolset. The book is divided into three major parts. The first part concentrates on issues that developers face both from within their organizations and from their peers. The authors weigh the costs and benefits of using Ruby in enterprise development projects, the over-riding theme being that every developer should always aim to use the right tool for any particular job. The authors then examine the pros and cons of developing with Ruby, and where appropriate, compare Ruby to other languages, both conceptually and in code. The second part discusses techniques for communication and integration of systems. The authors describe how libraries and techniques are used to facilitate messaging, web development and communication automation. They also focus on how the strategies in the first section can be used with these libraries to make development more flexible and efficient. The last part shows how to manage data and integrate with existing data using Ruby. The authors describe techniques for using existing Ruby libraries that either replace popular Java libraries or can interface with existing data in a different way. They go on to show you how strategies covered in the first section can be used to enable Ruby to interact with existing assets or to build new data systems.","publisher_name":"Manning Publications","title":"Ruby in Practice","author_data":[{"id":"jeremy_mcanally","name":"Jeremy McAnally"},{"id":"assaf_arkin","name":"Assaf Arkin"}],"awards_text":"","urls_text":"","lcc_number":"","book_id":"ruby_in_practice"},{"isbn13":"9781933988658","isbn10":"1933988657","language":"","dewey_decimal":"005","physical_description_text":"525 pages","subject_ids":["computers_internet_home_computing_internet_general","computers_internet_computer_science_software_engineering_gen","computers_internet_computer_science_software_engineeri_aaaa0","computers_internet_databases_general","computers_internet_databases_general_aas","computers_internet_networking_networks_protocols_apis_genera","computers_internet_networking_networks_protocols_apis__aaaa0","computers_internet_networking_general","computers_internet_programming_languages_tools_general","computers_internet_programming_languages_tools_general_aas","computers_internet_programming_software_design_testing_engin","computers_internet_programming_general","computers_internet_programming_general_aas","computers_internet_software_general","computers_internet_software_general_aas","computers_internet_web_development_web_services","computers_internet_general","computers_internet_general_aas"],"publisher_id":"manning_publications","dewey_normal":"5","title_long":"","marc_enc_level":"~","title_latin":"The Well-Grounded Rubyist","publisher_text":"Manning Publications","notes":"","edition_info":"Paperback; 2009-04-28","awards_text":"","urls_text":"","lcc_number":"","book_id":"the_well_grounded_rubyist","publisher_name":"Manning Publications","summary":"The Well-Grounded Rubyist takes you from interested novice to proficient practitioner. It's a beautifully written tutorial that begins with the basic steps to get your first Ruby program up and running and goes on to explore sophisticated topics like callable objects, reflection, and threading. Whether the topic is simple or tough, the book's easy-to-follow examples and explanations will give you immediate confidence as you build your Ruby programming skills. The Well-Grounded Rubyist is a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the best-selling Ruby for Rails. In this new book, expert author David A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view of Ruby. It covers Ruby 1.9, and keeps the same sharp focus and clear writing that made Ruby for Rails stand out. Starting with the basics, The Well-Grounded Rubyist explains Ruby objects and their interactions from the ground up. In the middle chapters, the book turns to an examination of Ruby's built-in, core classes, showing the reader how to manipulate strings, numbers, arrays, ranges, hashes, sets, and more. Regular expressions get attention, as do file and other I/O operations. Along the way, the reader is introduced to numerous tools included in the standard Ruby distribution--tools like the task manager Rake and the interactive Ruby console-based interpreter Irb--that facilitate Ruby development and make it an integrated and pleasant experience. The book encompasses advanced topics, like the design of Ruby's class and module system, and the use of Ruby threads, taking even the new Rubyist deep into the language and giving every reader the foundations necessary to use, explore, and enjoy this unusually popular and versatile language. It's no wonder one reader commented: \"The technical depth is just right to not distract beginners, yet detailed enough for more advanced readers.\"","title":"The Well-Grounded Rubyist","author_data":[{"id":"black_david_st_clair","name":"Black, David St Clair"}]},{"summary":"Even good code can be tough to understand when you simply read it-even if you're a developer and you know what it does! A Domain Specific Language (DSL) helps a developer clearly express the intent of the code, and thus make it easier to work on the core business problem. Developers who migrate to Ruby from Java love Boo's ability to define a DSL for .NET in a just few lines of code. In Boo, the developer can define simple DSLs for .NET applications without suffering through the awkward XML usually required. Building Domain Specific Languages in Boo shows how to write DSLs for .NET. It starts by teaching what a DSL is. Then, it provides a fast-paced Boo tutorial. Readers immediately start putting this handy language to productive use as they learn how to implement DSLs in real code. The author shows how to create several types of DSLs, all with the goal of making the developer more productive.
